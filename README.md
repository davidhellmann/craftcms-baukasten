# CraftCMS Baukasten
Heavily opinionated starter kit for CraftCMS Projects.

## What's recommended
- Laravel Valet (https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/valet)
- PHP 7.4
- MySQL 8 / MariaDB
- optional: Redis `brew install redis`


## Configs
- Duplicate the `.env.example` file as `.env` and do your settings


## Database
Use the `seed_db.gz` as starting point. Create a new database with the settings from your `.env` file and import the `seed_db.gz` into it. The login credentials are: `superuser:superuser`


## Before you start
Go to `./` and do this: `valet link craftcms-baukasten` to create a domain like `craftcms-baukasten.test` (Info: Use the domain you used also in the `.env file`)


## Development
- `redis-server --daemonize yes` it's totally optional

### Why
I have developed several CraftCMS projects the last few years. For me, the setup and certain basics are what tend to take time away from me at the beginning of the project. 

For this reason there is the "Baukasten" to get started faster in new projects. It's a collection of good practices I have learned and adopted from past projects and from other people. It's heavily opinionated, but feel free to fork and modify it for your own needs.
